# Nth Fibonacci Number Kata

Write a function that generates the Fibonacci number for the nth position.

The [Fibonacci numbers][1] are a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, 
starting from 0 and 1. That is:

```math
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)  
```

First Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are:

| input | ouput |
| -------- | --------- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 8 |
| 7 | 13 |
| 8 | 21 |
| 9 | 34 |
| 10 | 55 |
